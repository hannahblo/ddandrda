\usage{
compute_tukeys_median_order(corders, startorder = corders[[1]] * 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{corders}{data set of partial orders (given in the form of a list of
posets, where every entry of the list is an incidence relation apposited
with its negation. (In terms of conceptual scaling we use here the
complemented scaling)}

\item{startder}{is a binary relation that can be used to restrict the space
of partial orders in which one searches the partial order(s9 with the highest
Tukey depth. Cencretely the search space is the space of all partial orders
in complemented conceptual scaling that are supersets of the relation
startorder. (startorder needs not to be a partial order))}
}
\description{
'compute_tukeys_median_order' computes that partial order
in the space of ALL partial orders (that are supersets of startorder)
that has the maximal Tukeys depth w.r.t. the given
data cloud represented by th given context (given in the form of a list of
posets, where every entry of the list is an incidence relation apposited
with its negation. (In terms of conceptual scaling we use here the
complemented scaling)
